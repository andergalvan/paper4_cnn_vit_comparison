# Comparing CNN and ViT for Open-Set Face Recognition  
**Code for the paper: _Comparing CNN and ViT for Open-Set Face Recognition_**

---

## üîß Installation

1. **Create a general virtual environment** using Python 3.10.12 (referred to as `ENV_GENERAL`)
2. **Install the required dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This is the main environment used for the pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation phases

‚ö†Ô∏è To download and prepare the images from the VGGFace2 and CASIA-WebFace datasets, two additional virtual environments are required (`ENV_VGGFACE2` and `ENV_CASIA`) to keep dependencies isolated.

## üìÅ Repository Structure
This repository is organized into two main components:

### Pretraining (VGGFace2)

Located in the `pretraining/` directory, this component handles the pre-training phase using the VGGFace2 dataset.

Contents include:

- `main_pretraining.py` and `utils.py`: Python scripts that handle the full pre-training process
- `pretrain_all_models.sh`: Shell script to automate pre-training for all models in the paper
- `analysis_vggface2/`: Exploratory analysis of the VGGFace2 dataset
- `setup_vggface2/`: Contains utilities and scripts necessary to download and prepare the VGGFace2 dataset

Excluded content: 

- `checkpoints/`: Intended to store model checkpoints saved during pre-training
- `logs/`: Contains training logs generated during pre-training runs
- `vggface2/`: Directory containing the VGGFace2 dataset

‚ö†Ô∏è The `checkpoints/` and `logs/` directories are not included in this repository due to their large size. These folders are generated automatically after running the pre-training script (`pretrain_all_models.sh`) and will contain model weights and training logs respectively.

‚ö†Ô∏è The VGGFace2 dataset (~83 GB) is also not included in this repository (`vggface2/`).

#### Dataset Download ‚Äì VGGFace2
To download and prepare the VGGFace2 dataset for pre-training:
1. Download the dataset ZIP file from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dyVQ7X3d28eAcjV3s3o0MT-HyODp_v3R/view
2. Move the downloaded ZIP file to: `/pretraining/setup_vggface2/`
3. Change to that directory: `cd pretraining/setup_vggface2/`
4. Unzip the dataset: `unzip faces_vgg_112x112.zip`
5. Create a separate Python 3.10.12 virtual environment dedicated exclusively to dataset preparation (`ENV_VGGFACE2`), activate it, and install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Convert the .rec dataset files to individual image files by running: `python3 rec_to_imgs.py`
7. Deactivate the `ENV_VGGFACE2` environment after completion

After executing the last script, a new folder will be created at: `/pretraining/vggface2/`. This directory contains the final, processed VGGFace2 image dataset, properly structured and ready for use in model pre-training.

### Fine-tuning and Evaluation (CASIA-WebFace)

The `CASIA-WebFace/` directory contains everything related to the fine-tuning and evaluation phases of the models using the CASIA-WebFace dataset.

Contents include:
- `main_finetuning.py`: Performs model fine-tuning for all models
- `main_evaluation.py`: Executes evaluation in both Closed-Set Recognition (CSR) and Open-Set Recognition (OSR) scenarios
- `.log` files: Log outputs from script executions
- `setup_casia_webface/`: Contains utilities and scripts necessary to download and prepare the CASIA-WebFace dataset

Excluded content:
  - `casia_webface/`:
    - `casia_webface/`: Original dataset extracted from .rec files
    - `casia_webface_imgs_mtcnn/`: Dataset cropped using MTCNN
    - `casia_webface_imgs_mtcnn_ordered/`: Dataset organized into (these last splits were created using the `split_known_unknown_dataset.py` script):
      - `train/`
      - `validation/`
      - `close_test/` (CSR scenario)
      - `open_test/` (OSR scenario)
- `finetune_evaluation_casia_webface/`: Stores fine-tuning results, metrics, and best model checkpoints

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to their large size, the `casia_webface/` directory and fine-tuned models in `finetune_evaluation_casia_webface/` are not included in this repository. However, the fine-tuned models can be obtained by executing the `main_finetuning.py` script.

#### Dataset Download and Preparation ‚Äì CASIA-WebFace
To download and prepare the CASIA-WebFace dataset:
1. Download the dataset ZIP file from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KxNCrXzln0lal3N4JiYl9cFOIhT78y1l/view
2. Move the downloaded ZIP file to: `CASIA-WebFace/setup_casia_webface/`
3. Change to that directory: `cd CASIA-WebFace/setup_casia_webface/`
4. Unzip the dataset: `unzip faces_webface_112x112.zip`
5. Create a separate Python 3.10.12 virtual environment dedicated exclusively to dataset preparation (`ENV_CASIA`), activate it, and install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Convert the .rec dataset files to individual image files by running: `python3 rec_to_imgs.py` (this creates the original dataset in: `CASIA-WebFace/casia_webface/casia_webface`)
7. Deactivate the `ENV_CASIA` environment after completion
8. Activate the general environment (`ENV_GENERAL`)
9. Run MTCNN-based face cropping: `python3 mtcnn.py` (this creates: `CASIA-WebFace/casia_webface/casia_webface_imgs_mtcnn`)
10. Create train, validation, CSR and OSR evaluation splits: `python3 split_known_unknown_dataset.py` (this creates: `CASIA-WebFace/casia_webface/casia_webface_imgs_mtcnn_ordered`)
